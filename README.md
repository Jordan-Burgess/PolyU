# PolyU - [Live Site](https://poly-u.netlify.app/)
PolyU is a language exchange app users can use to chat with other users in their target language.

## User Stories
This app can be used by anyone interested in learning a new language and wants to focus on language immersion through talking with real natives and attending events. To aid in learning, users will be able to translate messages that are received. Users will have a profile page about themselves and will be able to see profile pages of other users to see if they are interested in making that person a language partner. Lastly, users can also create and host language events or search and attend events that have already been created.
